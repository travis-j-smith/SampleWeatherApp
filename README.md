# Sample Weather App

This project was written to be used as part of an introduction to Android tutorial.

You will need to provide your own [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) API Key.  I suggest creating an `api_keys.xml` file in your `res/values/` directory since it has already been added to this repository's `.gitignore` file.
